# optiflip - Nvidia <~> Intel Hybrid Graphics Helper Scripts

These repo contains some helper scripts and sample X11 configs to assist in manually changing the active graphics card in an Optimus hybrid graphics machine, switching back/forth between Nvidia and Intel.

The inspiration of these tools is [this documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_P1#Hybrid_graphics_with_bbswitch_only) from Arch Linux on the Lenovo Thinkpad P1 laptop.
